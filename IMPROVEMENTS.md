# Project Improvement Proposals for libuvhttp

This document outlines potential areas for improving the `libuvhttp` library. These suggestions are categorized into functionality, developer experience, and quality assurance.

## 1. Functionality Enhancements

*   **WebSocket Support**: Implement WebSocket protocol support to enable real-time, bidirectional communication. This would likely involve handling the HTTP Upgrade mechanism and managing the WebSocket framing protocol.
*   **HTTP/2 Support**: Integrate a library like `nghttp2` to add support for HTTP/2. This would improve performance through features like multiplexing and header compression, making the library suitable for more modern applications.
*   **Middleware Chaining**: Introduce a middleware mechanism to allow chaining multiple request handlers. This would make it easier to implement reusable logic for common tasks such as logging, authentication, and CORS handling.
*   **Optimized File Sending**: Add a dedicated function to send files efficiently, possibly using `uv_fs_sendfile` (if available and appropriate for the design). This would improve performance for serving static assets.

## 2. Developer Experience (DX)

*   **API Documentation**: Add comprehensive Doxygen-style comments to all public functions and data structures in `uvhttp.h`. This will enable automatic generation of a full API reference.
*   **Build System Modernization**: Migrate the build system from `Makefile` to `CMake`. This would simplify cross-platform development (especially for Windows) and improve dependency management.
*   **Expanded Examples**: Provide more practical examples demonstrating common use cases, such as building a JSON API, handling file uploads, or integrating with other libraries.
*   **Improved Error Handling**: Enhance the error reporting mechanism to provide more detailed error codes and descriptive messages, which would simplify debugging for end-users.

## 3. Quality and Testing

*   **Increased Test Coverage**: Expand the test suite in `tests/test_main.c` to cover more edge cases and error conditions. This includes tests for invalid requests, connection timeouts, large payloads, and high concurrency scenarios.
*   **Static Analysis Integration**: Introduce static analysis tools like `clang-tidy` or `cppcheck` into the development workflow to automatically detect potential bugs and code quality issues.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Set up a CI pipeline using a platform like GitHub Actions. The pipeline should automatically build the project and run the test suite on every push and pull request to prevent regressions.
*   **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish a suite of performance benchmarks using tools like `wrk` or `ab`. These benchmarks should be run periodically, ideally within the CI pipeline, to monitor performance and detect regressions.
